# Covid_19_CaseStudy

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard that analyzes the impact of Covid-19 across India. 
The objective is to transform large and complex Covid datasets into clear visual insights that help users understand trends, regional impact, and healthcare response easily.

The dashboard is designed for non-technical users such as students, analysts, policymakers, and healthcare teams who want quick and meaningful insights without deep technical knowledge.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the spread and impact of Covid-19 across Indian states
- Analyze trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths over time
- Study demographic impact based on age groups and gender
- Compare testing activity and laboratory infrastructure by state
- Track vaccination progress and dose distribution

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- **State-wise Covid Impact:** Visual map showing how different states were affected
- **Time Trend Analysis:** Growth of confirmed, recovered, and death cases over time
- **Age Group Analysis:** Distribution of cases across different age categories
- **Gender Analysis:** Comparison of Covid impact by gender (excluding missing values)
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Number of ICMR testing labs in each state
- **State-wise Testing:** Total samples, positive, and negative cases by state
- **Vaccination Analysis:** Comparison of first vs second doses and vaccine types
